        <h2>Carara National Park</h2>
        <p> Carara National Park with 4.700 hectares (10.340 acres) is a must see for anyone

interested in tropical biology. Its high species diversity and easy access makes this

a worthwhile trip. The park is located between the dry and the humid forest and the

result of this situation in an "ecotone" or melding area is what gives Carara its

diversity. There are trails that go through both zones where you can appreciate the

forest&#39;s exuberance and spot some animal species which inhabit the area.</p>

       <p>Many endangered and threatened species, like the American crocodile, live and

breed here. Carara is also considered a sanctuary of the rare and beautiful Scarlet

Macaw, the park's symbol, which is on the endangered list. In the park there are

approx. 200 couples which live and breed in absolute freedom.</p>

       <p>The word "Carara" is an indigenous term, reputedly meaning "river of crocodiles".

The area in which the reserve is located was occupied by an indigenous culture

that is thought to have been allied with groups located in the Central Valley from

300 B.C. to 1500 A.D. Extensive tomb sites have been excavated, including burial

places of the high status population which are remarkably complex. </p>


       <p>The best time to visit and enjoy Carara remarkable sites, is early in the morning or

late in the afternoon.</p>
