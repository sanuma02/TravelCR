        <h2>El Silencio Lookout Point in Arenal</h2>
        <p> El Silencio Mirador is a vast, 555-acre (225-ha) nature reserve located 7 miles (12

km) from La Fortuna and 3 miles (5 km) from the <a href="#/arenal" target="_blank">Arenal Volcano National Park.</a>

The reserve has over 250 acres (100 ha) of primary rainforest, much of which

includes old growth trees.  On the way you can enjoy different sceneries like giant

trees and plants with diverse shapes and colors, streams, pastures and you can

miss the view to the Volcano and its lake while you are in the viewpoint of the

reserve.</p>

       <p>There is a network of hiking trails that wind through much of this land. While

immersed in the rainforest, you can search for tropical creatures. In addition to

these trails, there is a mirador (Spanish for “lookout”) with incredible views of the

volcano and surrounding hillsides.</p>

       <p> Due to its close proximity to the volcano, El Silencio Mirador is specified as being

within a high-risk zone. Although construction is no longer permitted in this area,

the volcano hasn’t posed any problems since the 1968 eruption. What’s more,

Arenal entered into a resting phase in 2010; at present, the volcano is not erupting.</p>
