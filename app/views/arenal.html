        <h2>Arenal Volcano National Park</h2>
        <p>Arenal became an active volcano on July 29 1968 at 7:30 a.m. The flow devastated 12 square km. Big amount of materials were ejected like ashes, lapilli and bombs. The smallest materials were carried by wind to Guanacaste located at the west part of the country, and the biggest rock were deposited in an area within 5 km. Around 90 people were killed and two towns affected: Pueblo Nuevo and Tabacon.  </p>

       <p>At the west side tree craters were open: Crater A at 1050 meters (3360 ft), crater B at 1175 meters (3760 ft) and crater C at 1460 meters (4672 ft). Beside those tree craters the crater D or original one exists at 1633 meters (5250 ft).</p>

       <p>In 1991 an extension of 12.016 hectares (29.679 acres) were declared national park. </p>
       <p>In 1979 the Costa Rican Institute of Electricity finished the construction of a dam and forms the   Lake Arenal, sits at the base of the Arenal Volcano. It is the countryâ€™s largest landlocked body of water, with a surface that covers nearly 85 square kilometers (53 square miles) and a depth that reaches some 60 meters (197 feet). Around 30% of all the electricity in the country is generated from this lake.</p>
       <p>The lake is base of Wind surfing World Championship apart of many more activities.</p>
       <p>
         The nearest town is La Fortuna , bless by God for all the scenic beauty, were in a few minutes you can find all kind of tour like: hike into the great rainforest,  waterfalls, horse back riding, canyoning,  kayak, white water rafting, suspension bridges, fishing , canopy tour and much more.  
       </p>
       <p>
           Until 2010 was very common to see lava flowing constantly from the main crater, but in the last year the activity has been decreasing, but the beauty and the majestic of the volcano remind us about the Mother Nature greatness.
