        <h2>Chirripo National Park</h2>
        <p> Chirrip√≥ National Park, with 50.000 hectars ( 110.000 acres) which boasts the

highest peak in Costa Rica at 3.820 meters (12.500 ft) above sea level, is located

near the town of San Isidro de General about 60 miles southeast of San Jose.</p>

       <p>The upper reaches of the park, often cold and almost always cloaked in mist,

contain the northernmost example of the &quot;paramo&quot; life zone, which is typical of

high-elevation plains much farther south. The park also contains extensive areas of

lower montane and montane rain forest and offers excellent opportunities for

wildlife observation and nature photography. Coyotes, jaguars, other felines,

squirrels, rabbits, frogs, bird&#39;s owls and quetzals are the most common species

found.</p>

       <p>The park experiences wide temperature variation. It can be as warm as 24 degrees

C during the day and then drop to freezing at night. The altitude change between

sea level and the high country is severe enough to give some people altitude

sickness, particularly if they&#39;ve spent a week or two in a dugout canoe or lying on

the beach. </p>
